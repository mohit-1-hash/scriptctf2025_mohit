## Challenges

### 1. Div
**Description:** I love division  
**Solution:** 
1.I realised that i have to put a huge value to get 0 but then the constraints had limit of 10 characters.
2.So, then i put infinity and it worked unexpectedly i actually thought i should put float("inf") but when i tried that later if it might work it didn't work.
**Flag:** scriptCTF{70_1nf1n17y_4nd_b3y0nd}
