# ScriptCTF 2025 â€“ Mod Challenge

**Category:** Crypto  

---

### Challenge
Description: Just a simple modulo challenge


### Solution
1.First I was confused how this was solvable in one go.
2.I tried a few numbers it wasnt working.
3.I realised that the code was written in python not cpp.
4.In cpp when you use mod for negative numbers you just get negative answers.
5.But I realised that in python you get positive numbers and then i tried -1 and it worked.
6.It gave exactly -1 of the value.
